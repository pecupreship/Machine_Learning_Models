The KNN & SVM model used same dataset downkloaded from kaggle to predict diabetes. It was found out that SVM has the highest accuracy of 82% with False Negative = 18 while KNN model has accuracy of 79% with False Negatuve = 15. whikle FN is very crucial to such prediction like this, KNN model is better using this dataset.
Logistic regression model was used for heart disease predcition with hig accuracy of 80%. Dataset was downloaded from kaggle.
The dataset used for these three models; Keras Deep learning, MLP classifier (SKlearn) and Naive Bayes) was downloaded from the UCI repository. Same plant leaf dataset with size was fed into these three models and the result was as follows: Keras = 100%, MLP classifier = 95% and Naive Bayes = 90%. Therefore, for the purpose of this project, Keras deep learning was found the best classifier model.
